## How to Use:
1. Open the "index.html" file in a web browser.
2. Enter a word in the search bar and click the "Search" button.
3. The app will display the word's definition if found or suggest similar words.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- Fetch API for making AJAX calls to the dictionary API

## API Used:
The app uses the Merriam-Webster Dictionary API to retrieve word definitions and audio pronunciations. It requires an API key for access.

## Project Structure:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the user interface of the app.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing styles for the app's layout and components.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for handling user input, API calls, and displaying results.

## External Libraries:
- None

## Note:
- Before running the app, ensure an active internet connection to fetch data from the API.
- The API key (`apikey`) used in the JavaScript file is a placeholder. Replace it with your valid Merriam-Webster Dictionary API key to make the app functional.
